### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Github account! I hope you enjoy some of the projects I've set up here, and if you ever have questions about the coding decisions I made while producing them, please reach out to ask! I love talking code and questions are always welcom.

I'm currently working on projects related to Tries. I'd really like to find a way to use one to set up a from scratch auto complete, and going further I'd love to develop it into a full word proccesser. As soon as I have enough info on it to get started with a deployed project, I'll be sure to include a link to it here!

I'm working on learning more algoirthms as always, but a real focus for me currently is AWS systems. As the leading provider of cloud services, the tools they can provide me with a very powerful! PS: if you have any advice on resources to learn, please send them my way through my email below.

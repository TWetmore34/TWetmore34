Fullstack Developer
-------------------

Welcome to my Github account! I hope you enjoy some of the projects I've set up here, and if you ever have questions about the coding decisions I made while producing them, please reach out to ask! I love talking code and questions are always welcome. I am a recent graduate of Georgia Tech's fullstack web development program, and I'm looking to get a great start in the field! Taking advantage of everything I learned in my four year english degree and applying it to coding has made for one of the most rewarding experiences I could ask for, and I'm so excited to continue looking for more!
